
* Copy dctl.dcr into Adobe Director Xtras folder, e.g C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Director 11\Configuration\Xtras\

* Open Adobe Director and activate dctl in Xtra menu(this is done once, on further startups dctl should be active) 

* Once dctl is running and listening on the port the green light on the control panel should be on 

* Install PHP from http://www.php.net/downloads.php, PHP-5.2.X is known to work for sure

* Enable sockets support in PHP by uncommenting line "extension=php_sockets.dll" in php.ini file. 
  You may also need to edit PHP's extension dir(if you haven't done it), usually it's enough to 
  set it to "extension_dir=./ext" in php.ini file

* For your convenince add path to PHP into Path environment variable, this way you'll be able run PHP
  interpreter in the shell without specifying the path to it. On Windows it's done by clicking the right button
  on "My Computer", then going into "Advanced" tab, then clicking "Environment variables" button and 
  editing "Path" variable in the "System Variables" section. Simply add the directory containing php executable 
  into the dialog box.  Don't worry it's done only once :)

* Now go to the dctl directory, open shell and run the following command:

  c:\director-dctl\dctl PING

  You should see something like:

    13:45:33.62502 : Logged onto Director server '192.168.4.96:1626' OK
    13:45:33.62943 : Running task 'PING' []
    13:45:33.226733 : Task 'PING' executed(0.16 sec) OK
    -------------------------
    ping args:[]
  
  Hooray, everything seems to be working!

* You can list all available tasks by running HELP command, enjoy!
